# Teacher's aid

## Introduction

Teacher's aid has come to simplify the life of teachers. Whether they are teaching small private classes or a big group at school with this app they will be able to create, read, update, and delete their classes and students using a MERN stack application with React. Moreover by simply completing a daily register the app will automatic precise reports for each student. The platform is built with technologies such as MongoDB, Express, TailWind, JavaScript, brcryptjs, and JSX.

## Getting started

To start using the platform, visit
[[https://teachers-aid.netlify.app/](https://damafe-movies.netlify.app/)] and sign up if you are a new user or use your existing name and password.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in building Teacher's aid:

- MongoDB: Used to store the application data.

- Express: Used to handle HTTP requests and routes.

- JSX: Used as the view engine to generate HTML markup with JavaScript.

- JavaScript: Used for programming and building the application logic.

- TailWind: Used for the application's responsive design and styling.

- brcryptjs: Used for user password encryption and decryption.

- express-session: Used for handling user sessions.

- Morgan: Used for logging HTTP requests and responses.

- React: Used for building the frontend interface.

- NEW: This project gave me a great opportunity to use ZuStand for state management.

## Features (EXTRA)

Teacher's Aid has the following features:

- Landing Page: The platform's main page displays different squares with the names of each group the teacher has added. The background image and colours are relaxed to sooth the spirit of our educators.

- Group Page: Each group page is divided into two sections. The top section displays information from the database and shows a card with detailed information about the selected group. All of the values are initially empty but the user can perform fully CRUD from here. The bottom section displays all the students present in that group together with their averages on attendance, hw completion and participation. Teacher's can add/delete students within a group from here.

- Student page: A nice profile page for every student which also has CRUD functionality. Teachers can add details about each student including an URL with a profile picture for each one of them. Below their information you get to see links with each one of the registers they have. These are only readable.

- Report page: A very detailed automatically generated report using all the information from the registers the teachers complete by the end of every class. Not only does it show percentages but also AI texts on each one of the sections. By clicking on the send email button the platform will automatically send it to the email previously registered facilitating communication between families and the institution.

- Nav bar: A footer navigation bar with a 'back' and a 'log out' buttons.
